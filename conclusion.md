# Conclusion

## Major takeaways

1. Our first major takeaway was that in the majority of the occupations, men are paid more than women. Many articles claim that the gender wage gap is closing; for example, the _npr_ wrote an article titled, [_Here's Where And Why The Gender Wage Gap Is Closing_](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/19/1093607197/heres-where-and-why-the-gender-wage-gap-is-closing). The title is quite misleading because the gender wage gap is still a significant issue that affects many today. The dataset we used was created recently, in 2015. Our analysis revealed that **96% of occupations men were paid more than women**. This was a shocking surprise because this puts into perspective how severe this issue is.

2. Our second major takeaway was that there's quite a discrepancy in the average income of men and women. Comparing both men's and womenâ€™s weekly income, **men had an average income of $2,251**, while **women had an average of $1,836**; that is a **$415 difference** in their average wages.

3. Our third major takeaway was that there were different occupations where men and women thrived in. For the occupation where men were paid more than women, the occupation was **Personal Financial Advisors** with a $705 difference. For the occupation where women were paid more than men, the occupation was **Wholesale and retail buyers**, except farm products with a $99 difference.

At the start of this project, we were hoping to get a better grasp on the issue of gender inequality within the workforce. Although there has been a lot of progress in closing the gender wage gap, more changes need to be implemented to **achieve gender** equality within the workforce. In the end, these three major takeaways from our analysis show an important insight that the issue of gender inequality within the workforce is **still significant and ongoing**.
