## Major takeaways

To reiterate, our main focus questions going into this project were:
- What is the proportion of jobs that men are being paid more than women?
- Are there specific types of occupations where there is a gender wage gap?
- What type of occupations men and women tend to thrive in and what's the difference in income?

1.  Our first major takeaway was that in the majority of the occupations, men are paid more than women. Many articles claim that the gender wage gap is closing; for example, the *npr* wrote an article titled, [*Here's Where And Why The Gender Wage Gap Is Closing*](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/19/1093607197/heres-where-and-why-the-gender-wage-gap-is-closing). The title is quite misleading because the gender wage gap is still a significant issue that affects many today. The dataset we used was created recently, in 2015. Our analysis revealed that **96% of occupations men were paid more than women**. This was a shocking surprise because this puts into perspective how severe this issue is.

2.  Our second major takeaway was that there's quite a discrepancy in the average income of men and women. Comparing both men's and women's weekly income, **men had an average weekly income of \$2,251**, while **women had an average of \$1,836**; that is a **\$415 difference** in their average wages. Men earn way more than women yearly. Approximately $22,000 more than women. 

3.  Our third major takeaway was that there were different occupations where men and women thrived in. For the occupation where men were paid more than women, the occupation was **Personal Financial Advisers** with a \$705 difference. For the occupation where women were paid more than men, the occupation was **Wholesale and retail buyers**, except farm products with a \$99 difference. Even though women make $99 more than men in Wholesale and retail buyers, the difference is not as significant compared to the jobs men most thrived in.

## Most important insight and broader implications 

At the start of this project, we were hoping to get a better grasp on the issue of gender inequality within the workforce. Although there has been a lot of progress in closing the gender wage gap, more changes need to be implemented to **achieve gender** equality within the workforce. These three major takeaways from our analysis show an important insight that the issue of gender inequality within the workforce is **still significant and ongoing**. In the end, the broader scope is that gender inequality doesn't only exist in workplaces but also education, employment, medical care, political representation, and other matters affecting women worldwide.
