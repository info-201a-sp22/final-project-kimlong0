This project focuses on data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides occupations by employment and incomes between two genders, males and females.
Our aim is to investigate discrimination against women in the workforce. Whether or not there is a gender wage gap, a disparity within wages among equal employees is unfair and should be addressed. We wish to analyze the disparities within the data given about gender and employment throughout a variety of job fields. This is important to show that there needs to be progress being made within the workforce.

Hopefully, by looking at the results of the data, we can have a better grasp on the issue of gender inequality within the workforce.

## Major Questions
Our main question is whether a wage gap exists? We plan to further explore this question by asking three questions.

1. What is the proportion of jobs that men are being paid more than women?
2. Are there specific types of occupations where there is a gender wage gap?
3. Which occupation has the highest imbalance in gender ratio?

These questions are motivated by continuing discrimination against women in the workforce. Whether or not there is a gender wage gap, a disparity within wages among equal employees is unfair and should be addressed. We wish to analyze the disparities within the data given about gender and employment throughout a variety of job fields. This is important to show that there needs to be progress being made within the workforce.

## Dataset
For this project, the data set that we will be using to explore these questions is called “U.S. Incomes by Occupation and Gender” and can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonavery/incomes-by-career-and-gender" style="color: #9e5fb7">Kaggle</a>. <a href="https://www.bls.gov" style="color: #9e5fb7">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> collected the data using methods like the Current Population Survey, which is a survey carried out monthly by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey obtains the data needed for this collection by asking questions about people’s employment, their earnings, and their demographics. The bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS) because it allows them to understand what the employment situation is like in the United States; and thus, take or push for action from there. Without an overview and understanding of how the population of the country is doing, there would be no way to know if a need for more jobs or assistance is needed within the country. There are 558 unique occupations within the dataset. There are 7 unique features in the dataset, in the order of, “Occupation”, “All_workers”, “All_weekly”, “M_workers”, “M_weekly”, “F_workers”, “F_weekly.” Some ethical questions that can be considered when working with this data are, whether the CPS contains all demographics of a population equally, and if it is an online-based survey, how are people without access able to be represented. Some limitations behind this dataset could be that it only shows data from 2015, it has only binary genders (M and F), and it does not show any other demographic factors.

## Limitations

There are three limitations within the dataset; it doesn’t include data on non-binary groups of people. A challenge is determining how much of the data can be applied to answering the question of, “Is there a wage gap?”. There are some hidden factors that the data doesn’t show, such as, “How long have they been working, as they could have acquired bonuses?”, “How many hours do they work?”, “What are their levels of expertise, as some people could get paid more due to being more knowledgeable?”, or “How far up are they in management, as people with higher roles tend to have higher pay as well?” All these factors need to be considered for this data to show a more accurate representation of whether there is a wage gap. Second limitation is not knowing their race and ethnicity. It would be interesting to see how racism and intersectionality come into play. Third limitation is the exclusion of other genders. There are more than two genders other than female and male. Many people identify as transgender, gender neutral, non-binary, and other identities. According to Kelin and D'Ignazio, the exclusion of certain groups is called, "stranger in the dataset". This means, certain group(s) is removed from the collection and maintenance of data. There's a loss of other perspectives from other genders that are not included in this dataset which doesn't allow to fully assess the gender equality among all genders. 

## Ethical question

Based off one of our limitations, one ethical question is: does the dataset fully represent gender-inequality in the US? Our core main aim was to get a better understanding of gender-inequality, not just male and female. In the dataset we are using, it only included male and female. However, many people don't identify as male or female. The absence of data for other genders doesn't allow us to get an understanding on the gender-inequality among other genders.
